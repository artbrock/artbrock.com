# Who We Are

Targeted Currencies Network, LLC, was founded in early 2004 by a handful of folks interested in designing, developing and implementing systems and technologies that leverage incentives, currencies and exchanges to improve the flow of resources for people, organizations, and communities.

Our people include award-winning business leaders, a market financier, some overly-smart system architects, hungry entrepreneurs, an enlightened marketeer, and a cadre of code-crunching geeks.  We also draw from a pool of over 40 consultants with expertise in business, law, technology, incentives and finance.

The spokesperson of Targeted Currencies Network is Arthur Brock, a life-long visionary. Read more about Arthur Brock, or request more information about our other contributors and consultants.
