# Recent Changes Camp - Geekpower meets global change

We're in the midst of the Recent Changes Camp, a geeky un-conference happening now in Portland. Arthur and I came up in the little RV, and Mike B (one of our great geeks) flew up to join us.

We're here to build partnerships and collaborate with people around our schemes - OS Earth, SourceTree, etc. There's some exciting energy with what we're doing.

I attended a session yesterday about Jyte, a brand new site that lets users make claims about themselves or others, and then the community votes on these claims to agree or disagree. Their site is an experiment in trust metrics, and is one example of how geeks are trying to work out the need for community trust and reputation. Check it out!
