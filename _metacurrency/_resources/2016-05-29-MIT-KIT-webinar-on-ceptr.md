We gave this presentation at the invitation of MIT’s Kerberos and Internet Technology team. “Just a Spoonful of Ceptr” is an introduction to Ceptr , a low-level system for organizing computing and communications. Ceptr emerged from the MetaCurrency Project’s efforts to build platforms that enable systems to be resilient and distributed at the lowest level.
