## BALLE Conference and pre-conference events happening this summer

I know we've been horrible about updating this blog.

Arthur and I are on the east coast, having a slightly-impromptu meeting with Eric Harris-Braun of Open Money, Chris Linstrom of The E.F. Schumacher Society, and Cara Taussig and Amy Kirschner of The Burlington Currency Project, all players in creating and supporting localized currencies. In the meeting we've been updating each other on our own projects and having more dialogue on how we can support each other in this work.

What I want to share at this point is about the BALLE Conference and other pre-conference events happening in Burlington, VT this summer.

**Open Collective 2006**, for the local currency community
June 5 -7 2006 in Burlington, Vermont

This is a mixed open space and presentation event taking place before the "Creating Sustainable Communities" conference presented by the Business Alliance for Local Living Economies (BALLE) on June 8 - 10th, 2006. Among the many sessions taking place is "Money in Local Living Economies" happening on June 8th.

Registration for the BALLE event(s) is available. You can also get more information about the pre-conference events by emailing Chris Linstrom or Amy Kirschner directly.  I will post more information here when it is made available.
