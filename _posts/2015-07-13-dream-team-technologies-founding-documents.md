<div> </div><div>In 1996 I started a company with some friends with the intention of creating "community at work together." This company became a HUGE source of my personal growth and development, broad entrepreuneurial experience, intentional culture creation and is what set me on the path into alternative currencies because of the innovative performance measures we created to manage a managerless organization.  I'm sharing our founding documents below because I find them very inspiring and they're not online anywhere.  </div><div> </div><div>Actually, I usually cry when reading them aloud… especially the Statement of Accountability.</div><div><!--break--></div><div><hr>##  ## Vision / Mission / Purpose</div><div> </div><div>**Vision:  **We see the possibility of business as an intimate community working and playing together, an inspiring environment where people are fulfilled, fully expressed and exploding with growth.</div><div> </div><div>**Mission: **Our mission is to be a wildly successful example of a business which answers today's need for people-centered business, to be a dynamic and responsive team, grounded in integrity and committed to service.</div><div> </div><div>**Purpose: **Through our teamwork we will generate extraordinary abundance and an ideal work environment.
