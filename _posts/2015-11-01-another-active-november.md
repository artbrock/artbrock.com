<div>Last November I committed to write and publish every day. I posted 32 blogs many were about Agile Learning Centers and MetaCurrencies, a bit about Ceptr and Next Internet design. I've only posted a handful since then.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>So this year I'm going ot make a similar commitment, but allow for weekends off. I'll write and publish daily for every weekday (at least 20 posts in November). Most will be about Ceptr as we're actively preparing to unveil the technology we've been working on for years now. But I'm sure some will be about currencies, community building and a bit of 21st Century Education in the mix.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>You can track them here although some may be crossposted to other sites (like <a href="http://ceptr.org">Ceptr </a>or <a href="http://artbrock.AgileLearningCenters.org">21st Century Education</a>)</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Any writing requests?</div>
