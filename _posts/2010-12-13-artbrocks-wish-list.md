Since I'm not too easy to buy gifts for, this page has been placed here in response to requests for gift ideas for birthday or Christmas.

## Stuff

- Shoe Repair at [Dardano's](/dardanos/shoe-repair)
- A nice AM Yoga DVD
- Trikke T12 replacement tubes ([info](/trikke/inner-tubes))
- Trikke T12 replacement tires ([info](/trikke/trikke-tire))
- Motorcycle cover to protect it from the elements
- Balaclava for riding motorcycle in cold weather ([like this one](/amazon/balaclava), so it fits under my
helmet)
- Amazon Gift Certificate for various tech items

## Gift certificates for places I frequent

- [Szechuan Restaurant](/szechuan) - The old standby when I don't feel like cooking dinner.
- Bardo: My second home/office - a coffee house on South Broadway.  You'll have to call them. Just tell them to add the balance to my existing gift card. 303-629-8331 (They can look it up by my name or just tell them it's card #12.)
- [Floyd's Barbershop:](/floyds-barber-shop) For haircuts every few months.

- [India Oven:](/india-oven-denver) Best vegetarian buffet.
