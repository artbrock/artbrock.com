I'm way overdue for an update here. I have about 20 partially written posts that I've just never finished. I guess I just need to put them up however they stand.

So Eric and I decided to translate all our abstract MetaCurrency theory into practical, engaging action and start [Emerging Leader Labs](/emerging-leader-labs).

We're creating a template for social impact incubators to flourish outside of the monetary economy.

One of our participants captured the spirit of the project pretty darn well in this new video he just made. Go Ben!
