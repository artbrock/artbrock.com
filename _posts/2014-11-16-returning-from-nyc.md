<p>I went down to NYC for the weekend to spend some time with Timothy. It was good to get some time with him, although we did spend a bunch of that time watching episodes of Psyche. :) I drove Sarah&#39;s girls (Lily, Georgia &amp; Ruby) down with me and brought them back too. That made the drive a lot more fun.</p><p>On the way down, I swung by the Retreat Center that I&#39;m entertaining notions of acquiring as a campus for all these world-changing projects. It was good to get a glimpse, but I haven&#39;t arrived at complete clarity about moving forward with that approach yet.</p><p>I spent a bunch of time today writing...I added to the <a href="http://www.artbrock.com/blog/reputation-orthogonal-exchange">Reputation piece </a>I wrote yesterday with diagrams and more meaty content. &nbsp;I hope that it is useful to other people doing currency design and helps prevent the one of the most common mistakes I see happening in currency designs.</p><p>I think I&#39;m going to count that work as the bulk of my day&#39;s writing/publishing rather than throw some other half-baked thing together for today.&nbsp;</p><p>Now I&#39;m back upstate and hoping to get more Ceptr documentation and development with Eric done this week!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
