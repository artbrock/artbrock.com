## Status of Holo Network

- link to posts about Alpha launches

### Membranes

* Privacy of address spaces
* Composability of bridges
* Validation of new agents

### Agent-Centric Design

* Global discoverability of local state changes
* Countersigning state changes of multiple agents (fuel example)
* Deterministic Proofs amidst eventual consistency (election example)
* CRDTs

### Micro-Services

* Single data integrity engine, many UIs
* Reducing and simplifying updates and upgrades
