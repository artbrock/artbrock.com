![To Do List]({{ site.urlimg }}To-Do.png)

So it's the end of a month of daily writing and posting… I've already posted some reflections about what I've learned from the process, and although I have a number of partially written posts I could tackle to post tonight, I find that instead I want to talk about what's next.

Although there's certainly been some value in the practice of daily posting, I fear I'm compromising quality for frequency.  I'm tempted to continue with a daily writing practice, and trying to make sure I have time structured for that. However, I'm not so sure I want to post from that writing on a daily basis.

For me there's a bit of a tension between writing freely and quickly, and writing something ready to be shared. I want to keep a flow of free writing, but then come back and edit it for publication. And I'm game to commit to publishing weekly, and I'd like to post even a few times a week, but with only the "promise" for once a week.  That certainly feels quite doable at the moment since I just managed to do it 7 times per week for the past 30 days.

So… November ends with a bunch of loose ends. This is the TO DO list as I see it.
