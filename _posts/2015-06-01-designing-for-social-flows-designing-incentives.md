<p>Find my contribution to Chapter 6 of <a href="/blog/designing-social-flows-chapter-6-designing-incentives">Designing for Social Flows</a> on Designing Incentives. It is still pending final edits and publication with <a href="http://www.triarchypress.net/jean-russell.html">Triarchy Press</a>:&nbsp;</p><p>Personally, I wanted the book title to be "Designing Social Flows..." but others felt that was a bit to heavy handed. :)</p>
