## Commons Engine
We intend to turn the management of Ceptr and its software ecosystem over to a Sovereign Accountable Commons (our counterpart to a DAO - decentralized autonomous organization). For us this means building:
 - Sophisticated value accounting
 - Commons-based asset management
 - A cryptocurrency for purchase (and pre-purchase of assets)
 - Integrated/pluggable governance
 - Royalties & Rewards (What if you earned royalties on code (or other assets) you shared.)

Since we have to build these things for ourselves, we will also share them as a tool for launching platform cooperatives (think Uber without an extractive corporation in the middle).

Expect to see more about this, our new partnerships in the space, and maybe even a crowdfunding campaign to help get it launched.
