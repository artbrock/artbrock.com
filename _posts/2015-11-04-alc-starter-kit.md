<img alt="ALC Toolbox" src="{{ site.urlimg }}images/ALC_Starter_Kit.png" style="width: 433px; height: 350px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; float: right;">I'm not going to post all 70 pages of the Agile Learning Center Starter Kit here, but it is a big chunk of writing that I spent a couple weeks this summer authoring. &nbsp;So, I figure it really counts as writing that I'd like to share.

What's exciting is that we haven't particularly promoted the Starter Kit much yet, and we've had a couple hundred downloads from all over the world and a dozen or so ALC start-up groups that have signed on because of it.

So, if you're looking for solutions for 21st Century education and ready for a framework to support children in designing their own education, then you should <a href="http://StarterKit.AgileLearningCenters.org">download the Starter Kit</a> (disclaimer, it's still a BETA / draft).
