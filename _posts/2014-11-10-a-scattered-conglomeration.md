<p>I actually spent a fair amount of time today writing, and don't really have much of a new blog entry to show for it. What I do have to share is:</p><ol><li>I went back and edited some <a href="/blog/those-kids-and-their-darn-gadgets">recent entries</a> where I had left some sections in note form, not quite complete. Including mostly finishing making a case for embracing modern digital literacy for today's youth.</li><li>I edited an article on Semtrex (SEMantic Tree Regular EXpressions) in Ceptr that Marc Clifton has started working on. (No public link yet.)</li><li>I made some updates to the Ceptr Apocalypse and am heading back toward getting my groove on in writing there.</li><li>I set up and customized my <a href="http://artbrock.AgileLearningCenters.org">Agile Learning Centers blog</a> and reposted some of my recent relevant posts there.</li></ol><p>Of course, there's always email. And Articles of Incorporation for ALC Mosaic... but that's not really the kind of writing I had in mind for here. At least I feel like I'm establishing a bit of a daily pattern and regimen for getting stuff shared and that was my goal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
