Instead, I'm working on extending the incomplete ending of last night's post on Pervasive Consciousness and Language to get it into better sense-making shape.</p><p>There's just a couple days left of November for my daily posting commitment. I don't know that I'll keep this up beyond November, but I'd like to do something that has me posting with high regularity.</p><p><!--break--></p><p>If I scale back to posting 3 days/wk or 5 days/wk will I be less reliable?</p><p>I've got to sort out what my next commitment is. But this month has been great for getting the juices flowing and clearing the path for more focused writing on Ceptr.</p><p>How regularly do you want me to post? &nbsp;Who is reading these things?</p>
