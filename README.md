# Arthur Brock's Personal Web Site

This is the source code repository for [Arthur's web site](http://artbrock.com).  

It uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to produce static HTML pages served out by [GitHub](http://github.com) and currently uses the [Feeling Responsive](https://github.com/Phlow/feeling-responsive) Theme.

There are buttons on each web page which enable you to **contribute edits to improve the content** using web-based editing tools. Please feel free to provide feedback or edits (although, it's possible not every suggestion will get included).

Also, there *should* be Disqus discussions on each post for you to **post comments**.

[Let me know]() if anything would make this site more useful.
