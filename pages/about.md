Welcome. My web site is a catch-all for the variety of projects and activities that I’m involved in. I'm not too reliable about sending correspondence or newsletters, so friends have encouraged me to provide a place to keep up.

Unfortunately, after my first web site in 1995, the novelty wore off and I'm not consistent for posting much about myself. Now I’m being poked, prodded and supported in doing so. Activity tends to come in waves, as I discipline myself to publish for windows of time.

I invest most of my life-energy on projects that I believe support and accelerate the harmonious evolution of humanity. We live in strange and miraculous times. Rapid transition and transformation surround us, but the outcomes of these transitions are still uncertain. Humanity is teetering on the brink of disaster, but I believe that we have much greater capacities than we realize. I am working on tools, technology, communities, schools, and currencies which unleash those capacities for the mutual benefit of all.

You can find out more <a href="#about">about me</a> on the bottom of this page or learn about <a href="/projects">projects</a> old and new. I’m also trying to include regular media from my activities on the “<a href="/deeper">go deeper</a>” page.

## About Me

<strong>BRIEF BIO: </strong>Arthur Brock builds targeted currencies which shape the social dynamics of our emerging post-industrial economy. He has created more than a hundred designs for multi-currency systems and his software company has built and deployed dozens of those systems.

Initially, Arthur put his experience Artificial Intelligence to use at GM, Chrysler &amp; Hughes, but shifted his focus to building intelligence into social architectures rather than to computers. He started student-run schools and award-winning, employee-run businesses and discovered the engine that runs these types of organizations involve specific patterns of incentives and feedback. He began to unlock secrets of the Social DNA by which people operate and the critical role of currencies for programming these patterns.

Arthur’s designs include currency systems for: collaborative scientific research, sustainable fishery management, corporate compensation plans, employee stock options, community-based economic development, business barter and exchange, triple-bottom-line trade credits, open source software development, customer loyalty programs, water rights, recirculating gift certificates, community service, employee performance management, arts &amp; culture development, efficient resource sharing &amp; management, and community &amp; environmental impact assessment.

Based in New York City, Arthur Brock consults worldwide with organizations which are actively restructuring themselves for the new economy. <a href="/contact">Contact him here</a><
