			<h2 id="fast-strong-and-easy-start">Fast, Strong, and Easy Start</h2>

<p>On New Years Eve, the last day of 2016, Eric Harris-Braun and I <a href="/holochain/proto">started building Holochain</a>. The basic design came from one part of <a href="/ceptr">Ceptr</a> an advanced computing and currencies platform we’d been working on for years.</p>

<p>Two months later, on the first week of March 2017, we had our <a href="/ceptr/hackathons">first Hackathon in San Francisco</a> for people to build apps on Holochain.</p>

<p>It was an invitation only event for friends who understood our tools were not yet mature. Yet even then, people built complete P2P <a href="#">dApps</a> in just a few days in JavaScript and Lisp that essentially worked.</p>

<p>The people who came expressed shock and surprise. Folks who had wrestled with launching tokens and dApps on Ethereum praised the ease of building on Holochain. They also felt safer of launching a dApp on it, knowing they could start it invitation-only and then expand the reach and scope of live-tested versions, instead of being “written in stone” on a permanent blockchain.</p>

<p>They said: <em>“Wow, its a distributed app platform that’s actually distributed!”</em></p>

<p>And” <em>“It feels like we’re building the plane while flying it, but it’s exciting that actually flies!”</em></p>

<p>Our first weekend hackathon yielded <a href="/holochain/holochat">HoloChat</a> (a multichannel Slack-like chat), <a href="#">TrustGraph</a> (for making decentralized, censor-proof, reputational claims), and two versions of Clutter, a twitter clone – <a href="/holochain/clutter">one in JavaScript</a> and <a href="/holochain/cludder">one in Lisp</a>, which both used the same UI.</p>

<h2 id="the-power-of-holochain-grows">The Power of Holochain Grows</h2>

<p>Making apps was possible, but there were a bunch more features to implement for permisisons, security, sharding of the DHT, etc.</p>

<p>We worked over the next six months improving networking, enhancing testing, benchmarking performance, and learning the <a href="/holochain/mixins">design patterns</a> and idioms of building agent-centric dApps on an eventually-consistent, sharded, validating DHT.</p>

<p>And after some official Alpha releases, we held <strong>LOTS more Hackathons:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Barcelona Spain,</li>
  <li>Vaduz Liechtenstein,</li>
  <li>Riga Latvia,</li>
  <li>Bristol UK,</li>
  <li>Porto Portugal,</li>
  <li>Sebastapol California,</li>
  <li>London UK,</li>
  <li>Copenhagen Denmark,</li>
  <li>Sydney Australia,</li>
  <li>Melbourne Australia,</li>
  <li>Vancouver BC,</li>
  <li>Austin Texas,</li>
  <li>New York City (twice),</li>
  <li>Denver Colorado,</li>
  <li>Sao Paolo Brazil,</li>
  <li>Amsterdam Netherlands,</li>
  <li>Pittsburgh PA (CMU), etc.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="viable-holochain-apps">Viable Holochain Apps</h2>

<p>Out of those events came about 60 pretty cool Holochain apps to various stages of completion. They ranged from proof-of-concept of back-end features to pretty polished experiences with a full UI. Some noteworthy ones that come to mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/holochain/dpki">DPKI</a>: Distribute Public Key Infrastructure – crypto-key management,</li>
  <li><a href="/holochain/holodex">HoloDex</a>: Indexing overlay app for searching a sharded DHT,</li>
  <li><a href="/holochain/HCHC">hAppStore</a>: A distributed directory for distributing distributed apps),</li>
  <li><a href="/holochain/fractal-wiki">Fractal Wiki</a>: structure wiki of nexted cards (like Decko),</li>
  <li><a href="/holochain/transactor">Transactor</a>: A basic mutual credit currency,</li>
  <li><a href="/holochain/touchpoints">Touchpoints</a>: Mobile NFC enabled interaction logging system,</li>
  <li><a href="/holochain/fedwiki">Federated Wiki</a>,</li>
  <li><a href="#">Community Book Sharing Library</a> &lt;– self-explanatory,</li>
  <li><a href="#">RaveMaker</a> Party announcement and support system,</li>
  <li><a href="#">Arcade City P2P</a>: Ridesharing app,</li>
  <li><a href="#">Prediction/Betting market</a>, Augur-like,</li>
  <li><a href="#">Comet</a> P2P Reddit site,</li>
  <li><a href="#">P2P Credit Clearing Network</a>: ,</li>
  <li>Medical drug provenance / Supply Chain tracking system,</li>
  <li><a href="/holochain/smart-meter-mgmt">Electric Smart Meter Mgt</a>: IoT data recording /  sharing / kilowatt balancing</li>
  <li><a href="/holochain/unmute">UnMute</a> censor-proof blogging like Medium.com (later evolved into <a href="https://humm.earth">humm.earth</a>),</li>
  <li><a href="/holochain/holovault">HoloVault / Personas</a> personal data and identity management,</li>
  <li><a href="/holochain/craigs-list">New Craigslist</a>: self-explanatory – *also implemented in OCaml,</li>
  <li><a href="/holochain/holochess">HoloChess</a>,</li>
  <li><a href="#">Battleship</a>,</li>
  <li><a href="#">Massively Multiplayer Pong</a>,</li>
  <li><a href="#">MinerSweeper</a>: Real-time-ish multi-player minesweeper,</li>
  <li><a href="/holochain/errand">Errand</a>: Trello-like kanban boards for tasks,</li>
  <li><a href="/OmniProject/omni">Omni</a>: For publication of scholarly peer reviewed articles,</li>
  <li></li>
  <li><a href="#">Cannabis provenance and supply chain accountability</a>,</li>
  <li><a href="#">Shared To-Do List</a>,</li>
  <li><a href="#">Happy virus</a>: Infect your friends with fun and beneficial activities.</li>
  <li><a href="#">Junto</a>: Social network</li>
</ul>

<p>Whew! I’m sure there’s a bunch more I’m not remembering at the moment.</p>

<p>Notice how similar these dApps are to the kinds things we do on the web every day. Holochain is not relegated to slow crypto-gambling oand speculation as the only viable use-case. Storing data is cheap. Processing is efficient. Scaling is natural.</p>

<p>There are still many people saying the usefullness of dApps has not really ben demonstrated yet. That’s because they’re still looking at the kind of dApps that are viable on blockchain.</p>

<h2 id="holochains-dapp-architecture-proven">Holochain’s dApp Architecture Proven</h2>

<p>People still talk about Holochain as if it’s vaporware and doesn’t exist yet. This is in part because of confusion about expecting a MainNet or token. But Holochain is so efficient it doesn’t need to have a token to subsidize inefficiency.</p>

<p>Many people clearly don’t realize A LOT OF THINGS have been built on it and they have worked just fine. This is in part our failure to “hype” Holochain adequately and the apps built on it.</p>

<p>And more importantly, there are things that Holochain makes easy that are rather difficult to do on other decentralized platforms.</p>

<p>Show me another decentralized platform that can do real-time-ish games like MinerSweeper or Pong!</p>

<p>Try live-video-streaming on blockchain!</p>

<p>After 10 years of blockchain, where is an easy Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure?</p>

<h2 id="going-mainstream-with-agent-centric-design">Going Mainstream with Agent-Centric Design</h2>

<p>The main reason we broke Holochain out from Ceptr into a standalone framework that could go head-to-head with blockchain, was to P2P technology designs into mainstream use.</p>

<p>so we could establish long-term financial viability for both Holochain and Ceptr.</p>

<p>To achieve this we designed a commercial/fundable project of providing cloud-style hosting on top of Holochain as a scalabilty layer.</p>

<p>multi-stage funding strategy with the first phase involving a crowdfunding campaign for hardware and an ICO for the software, knowing its days were numbered, with a desire to raise the bar of integity for ICOs and their projects. We structured ours quite differently than most with specific attention on having it be <a href="ethical ICO">ethical</a> and responsible as possible.</p>

<p>So we designed <a href="/holo">HOLO</a> as a major project to be able to bridge obscure and marginalized crypto-apps to mainstream users by letting them just use their web browser as if it were any data-driven web site. We know Holochain has no inherent speed or scale bottlenecks, so that theoretically these Holo-hosted apps could scale to the size of Facebook or Twitter. And there wasn’t a blockchain-based project out there who could get anywhere near our performance or ease of devlopment.</p>

<p>So <a href="https://IndieGoGo.com/….">we sold Holo hosting boxes on IndieGoGo</a> and did an Initional Community Offering pre-selling hosting power on the Holo hosting network.</p>

<p><strong>Clarification:</strong> Holochain does not have a token or currency built in. It is designed for scalable P2P apps that people self-host so they can control their identity and data… not for tokens. Blockchain is so inefficient it has to pay people to run it and burn through those hashes in Proof-of-Work or place stakes in Proof-of-Stake. But Holochain apps are lightweight enough to run on your phone. We tested between 75-100 full nodes running on a Raspberry Pi with just 2Gb of RAM.</p>

<p><strong>Clarification Part II:</strong> Holo does have a currency. It has to have one that can do billions of micro-transactions daily so it can run an edge-based app hosting network. In other words, like AirBnB sells more room-nights than the largest hotel chains, but has never built a hotel. Holo seeks to compete with the big cloud hosting companies without ever having to build a data center by using the efficency and scalability of Holochain to tap into computing power wherever it already is. This computing power is to form the basis of Holo’s cryptocurrency with the currency always being backed/redeemable for the tangible asset of computing power. And the 1% transaction fees could fund Holochain and possibly even some of the development of Ceptr.</p>

<h2 id="bulletproofing-is-expensive">Bulletproofing is Expensive</h2>

<p>Once we sold out our ICO for around 30,000 ETH (when ETH was worth a little over $600), we needed to refactor Holochain for increased security and to run in browsers and on mobile phones and tablets so we could truly go mainstream.</p>

<p>We decided to rebuild in Rust so we could get the strong security, stability, and concurrency safety it provides, as well as be able to compile to Web Assembly (WASM) to run on browsers and light-clients. In mid-May, with funding and a larger development team, we estimated we needed 3 months to rebuild the Holochain prototype which had been built in Go.</p>

<p>We had been planning the rebuild for a while, and some of our developers we very excited about it. We targeted August 15th for our first Alpha release with all the features of the Go prototype.</p>

<h2 id="dev-targets-missed">Dev Targets Missed</h2>

<p>Five months later, as of January 15th, we still don’t have ALL the features of the original prototype. In fairness, we have a lot of other improvements to security, testing, troubleshooting, and the underlying infrastructure, but we still haven’t implemented all the features of the original. Now we’re poised to launch a Closed Alpha version of the Holo network on top of this partial functionality.</p>

<p>The learning curve and slowdown from building on Rust may not be as bad as it seems. Theoretically, it should save us a lot grief later and be significantly more secure. Rust is so strict that it won’t let you compile until you handle all sorts of possible vulnerabilities that most other languages just let you get away with. So it could be saving us later time and pain in fixing issues.</p>

<p>However, that’s not the part that concerns me the most – <strong>Holochain has gotten harder to use.</strong></p>

<h2 id="usability-for-web-developers">Usability for Web Developers</h2>

<p>We positioned Holo to be a web app hosting framework, but now have a version of Holochain that only lets you build apps in Rust. And how many web developers code in Rust?</p>

<p>After this Closed Alpha launch so that we have some kind of hosting network for the micro-servers we sold on IndieGoGo to be able to run something, we will probably scramble a bit to pop up V8 or SpiderMonkey so that web developers can build apps in JavaScript and a familiar context. Either framework can run any Rust apps compiled to WASM. (Note: We don’t have widespread agreement from our devs on exactly what approach to take here.)</p>

<p>Luckily, web developers can still use whatever frameworks they’re comfortable with for building the UI (React, Vue, Angular, Vanilla JS, whatever). That usability feature of Holochain has still carried over.</p>

<p>But here we are over a half year later, and instead of having a thriving ecosystem of apps on Holochain, we are starting over in a language that few devs have experience with.</p>

<h2 id="bootstrapping-the-app-ecosystem">Bootstrapping the App Ecosystem</h2>

<p>I’m concerned we underplayed the maturity of the prototype and discouraged people who were ready to build on it to wait for the Rust version. Now much of the world thinks Holochain is still vaporware when we have had a framework for almost 2 years that outperforms every other crypto platform that I’ve seen.</p>

<p>Should we have spun off sup ome cadre of devs, trainers, and marketers to get a bunch of apps up and running beyond the proof-of-concept phase? Yes, it seems we probably should have.</p>

<p>Luckily, there are few projects (like <a href="/humm">Humm.Earth</a>) that ignored our warnings and did go live on the Go version of Holochain.  But there were not enough of these for the community at large to take Holochain seriously.</p>

<p>Is it too late to leverage the Go version? Probably. We haven’t supported it or made updates in almost 6 months.</p>

<h2 id="recovering-from-misfire">Recovering from Misfire</h2>

<p>So, how do we recover from essentially holding the community back for 6 months telling them to wait for the next great thing?</p>

<p>We are poised to launch Holo, but don’t have an ecosystem of apps to host on it yet. The Closed Alpha will pretty much only have apps made by the Holo/chain dev team. We hope to get more apps going once people see this infrastructure is for real. But if we do a slight reset (to JavaScript as mentioned above), does that add more delay? Or does it accelerate adoption because of familiarity for web devs?</p>

<p>Realistically, the last 6 months have not been not all bad. We still have a strong core base of supporters, and word has been spreading over the past year. In places like Turkey, there seems to be an explosion of support stemming from some vocal and respected thought leaders. However, some people (myself included) are tired of the <em>talk</em> of how great Holo/chain will be and just want to see it running.</p>

<p>I’ve probably blathered on long enough here…</p>

<p>I’m just trying to be transparent about the fact that we don’t have all the answers, and in retrospect, have probably made some strategic mistakes. I’ve opened a lot of inquiries in this post, and I hope community members will weigh in with thoughts and feedback in the comments. How do we best serve you?</p>

<p>I think I’ll start a new post to highlight how seriously scalable and resilient the Holo hosting network architecture is. I’m really excited about getting some Alpha going so we can see what speeds and performance are like!</p>
